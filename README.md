## Abstract
>In computer security, botnets still represent a major cyber threat. Concealing techniques such as the dynamic addressing and the Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) require an improved and more effective detection process. To this extent, this data descriptor presents a collection of over 30 million manually-labelled algorithmically generated domain names decorated with a feature set ready-to-use for machine learning (ML) analysis. This proposed dataset enables researchers to move forward the data collection, organization and pre-processing phases, eventually enabling them to focus on the analysis and the production of ML-powered solutions for network intrusion detection.
>To be as exhaustive as possible, 50 among the most important malware variants have been selected. Each family is available both as list of domains and as collection of features. To be more precise, the former is generated by executing the malware DGAs in a controlled environment with fixed parameters, while the latter is generated by extracting a combination of statistical and Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics.
